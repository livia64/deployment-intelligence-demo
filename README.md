\# Deployment Intelligence Model



This document outlines a margin-aware deployment simulation framework designed to translate execution telemetry into financial visibility.



The model explores how deployment minutes, infrastructure cost rates, pricing assumptions, and volatility scenarios can be structured into a deterministic simulation layer.



The objective is not cost reporting, but economic foresight — enabling margin sensitivity analysis and portfolio-level stress exposure before scaling decisions.



For discussion purposes only.
